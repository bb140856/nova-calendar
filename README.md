<h1 align="center">Event calendar for Laravel Nova 4</h1>

<p align="center">An event calendar that displays Nova resources or other time-related data in your Nova 4 project on a monthly calendar view that adapts nicely to clear and dark mode.</p>

![The design of the calendar in both clear and dark mode](https://github.com/wdelfuego/nova-calendar/blob/main/resources/doc/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

This calendar tool for Nova 4 shows existing Nova resources and, if you want, dynamically generated events, but comes without database migrations or Eloquent models itself. This is considered a feature. Your project is expected to already contain certain Nova resources for Eloquent models with `DateTime` fields or some other source of time-related data that can be used to generate the calendar events displayed to the end user.

For any problems you might run into, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wdelfuego/nova-calendar/issues). For feature requests, please upvote or open a [feature request discussion](https://github.com/wdelfuego/nova-calendar/discussions/categories/ideas-feature-requests). Developers who are interested in working together on this tool are highly welcomed.

# Usage

The calendar just needs a single data provider class that supplies event data to the frontend, and for the data provider and tool to be added to your `NovaServiceProvider`:

1. Create a data provider class with a name of your choice anywhere you like in your project, or run the following artisan command to create the default data provider:

    ```sh
    php artisan nova-calendar:create-default-calendar-data-provider
    ```

    If you choose to make the data provider yourself, make it a subclass of `Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\DataProvider\MonthCalendar`.

2. Edit your `NovaServiceProvider` at `app/NovaServiceProvider.php` to add the calendar to its `tools()` method and to register your data provider class as the default calendar data provider:

    ```php
    use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\NovaCalendar;
    use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\Interface\CalendarDataProviderInterface;
    use App\Providers\CalendarDataProvider;

    public function tools()
    {
        return [
           new NovaCalendar,
        ];
    }

    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(CalendarDataProviderInterface::class, function($app) {
            return new CalendarDataProvider();
        });
    }
    ```

3. In your data provider, implement the `novaResources()` method to specify which Nova resources are to be included and which of their model's `DateTime` attributes define when the event starts and, optionally, when it ends.

    For example, let's say you: 
	- want to show all Nova users as single-day events on the date their accounts were created, and
	- want to show a SomeEvent resource that has both `starts_at` and `ends_at` timestamps in its underlying Eloquent model

	You would implement `novaResources()` as follows:

    ```php
    namespace App\Providers;

    use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\DataProvider\MonthCalendar;
    use App\Nova\User;
    use App\Nova\SomeEvent;

    class CalendarDataProvider extends MonthCalendar
    {
        public function novaResources() : array
        {
            return [
                User::class => 'created_at',
                SomeEvent::class => ['starts_at', 'ends_at']
            ];
        }	
    }
    ```

	- This method must return an array that maps Nova resource classes to attribute names (for events that only have a starting timestamp) or arrays of attribute names (for events that have both a start and an end timestamp).
	- Nova resources for which you specify a single attribute will be added as single-day events using the specified attribute to determine its date and time.
	- Nova resources for which you specify an array with two attribute names will be added as single or multi-day events for which the first attribute determines the start date and time, and the second attribute determines the end date and time. 
	- All specified attributes must be cast to a `DateTime` object by the underlying Eloquent model.
	- If you let `novaResources()` return an empty array, the calendar will work but will not contain any events.

   The `novaResources()` method is the only method that's required. You can include more types of Nova resources to be shown on the calendar by simply adding more class names and attributes.


4. If you're using Nova's default main menu, you're already done. 

    If you've defined your main menu manually in the `boot()` method of your `NovaServiceProvider`, don't forget to add a `MenuSection` that links to the calendar:

    ```php
    MenuSection::make('Calendar')
        ->path('/wdelfuego/nova-calendar')
        ->icon('calendar'),
    ````
5. You can define which views should be visible in Tool. Available views are: `month` and `week`, and can be defined in:

    ```php
    namespace App\Providers;

    use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\DataProvider\MonthCalendar;
    use App\Nova\User;
    use App\Nova\SomeEvent;

    class CalendarDataProvider extends MonthCalendar
    {
        public function calendarViews(): array
        {
            return ['month', 'week'];
        }
    }
    ```

    By default all views are visible, however if you decide to use only one view, the navigation buttons won't be shown.

That's it! Your calendar should now be up and running.

## Hotkeys
You can navigate through the months using the hotkeys `Alt + arrow right` or `Alt + arrow left` and jump back to the current month using `Alt + H` (or by clicking the month name that's displayed above the calendar).

# What events are shown on the calendar? 
Events for Nova resources the current user is not authorized to see due to Laravel policies are excluded from the calendar automatically.

All instances of a Nova resource will be shown if no Laravel policy is defined for the underlying Eloquent model or if the static `authorizable` method on the Nova resource class returns `false`, unless you hide them manually by implementing the `exclude` method on your CalendarDataProvider.

## Hiding events from the calendar manually
You can exclude Nova resources from the calendar by implementing the `exclude` method on your CalendarDataProvider.

For example, if you want to hide events for resources with an Eloquent model that have an `is_finished` property that is `true`, you could write:

```php
use Laravel\Nova\Resource as NovaResource;
```
```php
protected function exclude(NovaResource $resource) : bool
{
    return $resource->model()->is_finished;
}

```

# Customization
You can customize the display of your events and add badges and notes to them to make the calendar more usable for your end users.

## Event customization
You can customize event info (name, start time, end time, notes, badges) and customize the CSS styles applied to the event div by implementing the `customizeEvent(Event $event)` method in your calendar data provider. Every event gets passed through this method before it's delivered to the frontend. The method must return the customized event. 

By default, your events get the title that the Nova resource's `title()` method returns and the start time is set to the value of the attribute specified in your data provider's `novaResources()` method. Other event fields are left empty by default but can easily be loaded from the event's associated model:
```php
protected function customizeEvent(Event $event) : Event
{
    if($event->model())
    {
        $event->end($event->model()->datetime_end);
        $event->name($event->model()->name);
        $event->notes($event->model()->notes);
    }
    return $event;
}
```

Your customization can be a lot more complex, too:

```php
use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\Event;

protected function customizeEvent(Event $event) : Event
{
    // Give each event a duration of 4 hours (for display only)
    $event->end($event->start()->copy()->addHour(4));

    // For events that have an underlying Eloquent model..
    if($event->model())
    {
        // Prefix each event's name with its ID
        $event->name($event->model()->id .' - ' .$event->name());

        // Add a warning emoji badge if the end user should 
        // be warned about the model's state
        if($event->model()->isInACertainState())
        {
            $event->addBadges('⚠️');
        }

        // Add a note to the event that is displayed right below
        // the event's name in the calendar view
        if($event->model()->someSpecialCase())
        {
            $event->notes('Something special is going on');
        }
    }

    // Display all events without time info
    $event->hideTime();

    return $event;
}
```

The following customization methods with regard to the display of the `Event` in the calendar view are available:

### Chainable customization methods
All of these methods return the `Event` itself so you can chain them in the `customizeEvent` method:
- `hideTime()` hides start and end times in the calendar view. 
- `displayTime()` enables the display of start and (if available) end times.
- `withTimeFormat(string $v)` sets the format in which times are displayed, using PHP's [DateTime format](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php).
- `withName(string $v)` updates the name of the event.
- `withStart(DateTimeInterface $v)` updates the date and start time of the event.
- `withEnd(DateTimeInterface $v)` updates the end date and time of the event.
- `withNotes(string $v)` updates the notes displayed below the name and, if enabled, the time info of the event.
- `addBadge(string $v)` adds a badge to the event's upper right corner. You can simply set letters, short strings or emoji. The use of 'X' as a badge isn't recommended because it could be mistaken for a close button.
- `addBadges(string ...$v)` adds 1 or more badges with one call. This method doesn't expect an array but an argument for each badge you want to add.
- `removeBadge(string $v)` and `removeBadges(string ...$v)` do the same but they remove rather than add badges.
- `addStyle(string $v)` adds a CSS style to be applied to the event. The style needs to be defined in your `eventStyles` method (see 'Adding custom event styles' below).
- `addStyles(string ...$v)` adds 1 or more styles with one call. This method doesn't expect an array but an argument for each CSS style you want to add.
- `removeStyle(string $v)` and `removeStyles(string ...$v)` do the same but they remove rather than add styles.
- `withStyle(string $v)` - deprecated. Used to set the CSS style applied to the div of this specific event. Starting from release 1.2, multiple styles per event are supported; you should now use the `addStyle`, `addStyles`, `removeStyle` and `removeStyles` methods to manage event styles.

### Non-chainable customization methods
Corresponding methods are available in non-chainable form, if you prefer to work with those. 

These function as simple setters when you supply an argument, and as getters when you don't.
- `name(string $v = null) : string`
- `start(DateTimeInterface $v = null) : DateTimeInterface`
- `end(DateTimeInterface $v = null) : ?DateTimeInterface`
- `notes(string $v = null) : string`
- `badges(array $v = null) : array`
- `styles(array $v = null) : array`

## Customizing the CSS
You can customize the CSS that is applied to the event divs in the calendar view on a per-event basis, or on a global basis by customizing the default event style.

### Customizing the default event style
In your calendar data provider, implement the `eventStyles()` method to return the CSS that you want to apply to all events by default:

For example, to make the default style white with black text:
```php
public function eventStyles() : array
{
    return [
        'default' => [
            'color' => '#000',
            'background-color' => '#fff'
        ],
    ];
}
```

Defining a default style is not required; if you don't define it, the default default style will use white text on a background in your app's primary color as defined in `config/nova.php` under `brand` => `colors` => `500`. 

### Adding custom event styles
To add custom event styles, add them to the same array: 
```php
public function eventStyles() : array
{
    return [
        'default' => [
            'color' => '#000',
            'background-color' => '#fff'
        ],
        'special' => [
            'color' => '#f00',
        ],
        'warning' => [
            'border' => '1px solid #f00'
        ]
    ];
}
```

After you defined your styles in the `eventStyles` array, call `addStyle` or `addStyles` in your `customizeEvent` method using the names of the styles (in this example, 'special' or 'warning') to apply them to individual events.

The original `withStyle` and `style` methods are deprecated; `withStyle` is now an alias for `addStyle` and `style` is only supported on events that have at most one custom style assigned to it.

For example:

```php
use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\Event;
use App\Nova\SomeResourceClass;

protected function customizeEvent(Event $event) : Event
{
    // For events that have an underlying Eloquent model..
    if($event->model())
    {
        if($event->model()->isInACertainState())
        {
            $event->addStyle('warning');
        }
    }

    // Display all events that have a specific class of Nova
    // resource with a specific style:
    if($event->hasNovaResource(SomeResourceClass::class))
    {
        $event->addStyle('special');
    }

    // Or conversely, display all events that don't have a 
    // Nova resource with a specific style:
    if(!$event->hasNovaResource())
    {
        $event->addStyle('special');
    }

    return $event;
}
```
### Adding multiple custom event styles to a single event
You are free to assign multiple styles to a single event using the `addStyles` method.

Their CSS specifications will be merged in the order that they were added to the event, with styles added later overruling the ones added before it. Other, non-conflicting CSS properties defined by styles added before it will still be applied to the event as expected.

For example:

```php
protected function customizeEvent(Event $event) : Event
{
    if($event->model())
    {
        if($event->model() && $event->model()->isInACertainState())
        {
            $event->addStyles('special', 'warning');
        }
    }

    return $event;
}
```

## Calendar customization
### Changing the default menu icon and label
In your `NovaServiceProvider`, update the `tools()` method as follows:
```php
public function tools()
{
    return [
        (new NovaCalendar)->withMenuLabel('Label')->withMenuIcon('HeroIcon'),
    ];
}    
```

### Changing the first day of the week
In your calendar data provider, implement the `initialize` method and make a call to `startWeekOn()` to let the weeks start on the day of your choice. You can use the constants defined in `NovaCalendar` to specify the day.

For example, to start your weeks on wednesday:
```php
use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\NovaCalendar;

public function initialize(): void
{
    $this->startWeekOn(NovaCalendar::WEDNESDAY);
}
    
```

### Changing what happens when an event is clicked
Implement the following method in your calendar data provider to change the URL that the user is sent to when they click the event:

```php
protected function urlForResource(NovaResource $resource)
{
    return '/resources/' .$resource::uriKey() .'/' .$resource->id;
}
```
This example shows the default behavior. If you append `/edit` to the string, users will be sent directly to the resource's Edit view, instead of to its Detail view.

### Adding events from other sources
If the events you want to show don't have a related Nova resource, you can still add them to the calendar. In your calendar data provider, implement the `nonNovaEvents` method to push any kind of event data you want to the frontend.

The method should return an array of `Event` objects:

```php
use Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\Event;

protected function nonNovaEvents() : array
{
    return [
        (new Event("Now until tomorrow", now(), now()->addDays(1)))
            ->addBadges('D')
            ->withNotes('This is a dynamically created event')
    ];
}
    
```

If you are going to return a long list of events here, or do a request to an external service, you can use the `startOfCalendar()` and `endOfCalendar()` methods inherited from `Wdelfuego\NovaCalendar\DataProvider\MonthCalendar` to limit the scope of your event generation to the date range that is currently being requested by the frontend. 

Any events you return here that fall outside that date range are never displayed, so it's a waste of your and your users' resources if you still generate them.
